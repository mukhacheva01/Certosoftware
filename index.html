      <p class="review-text">My son who works in IT suggested I try this <br> <span></span> app after I was getting lots of strange <br> <span></span> messages and things happening on my phone.<br> <span></span> Since running it once a week I have had no <br> <span></span> viruses or malware problems. I also got a VPN<br> <span></span>  app so I think with both I’m all set!  </p></div>

        <p class="review-text">Love the ease and efficiency. Awesome <br> <span></span> app. Very informative and insightful if <br> <span></span> wanting to know more about your device. <br> <span></span> The added breach check.is a great bonus.<br> <span></span>  Check any email of they’ve ever been <br> <span></span> named in a data breach from years ago. <br> <span></span> Sweet tool. Love it highly recommend. <br> <span></span></p>

        <p class="review-text">This app is good if you need to identify <br> <span></span> certain vulnerabilities on your iPhone. If <br> <span></span> you have any issues, their customer <br> <span></span> service was quite helpful and responsive. <br> <span></span></p>

        <p class="review-text">I wish they had a VPN, I’d be signing up for that too. Apart from that the app is top notch. I had Certo on my last phone and it was the first app I put on this phone when I got it from the store. The scanner and other parts of the app are really easy and simple to use, even for a non-techie like me</p>
